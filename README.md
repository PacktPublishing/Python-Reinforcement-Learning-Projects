**Eight hands-on projects exploring reinforcement learning algorithms using TensorFlow**

## What is this book about?
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the next big leap in the artificial intelligence domain, given that it is unsupervised, optimized, and fast. Python Reinforcement Learning Projects takes you through various aspects and methodologies of reinforcement learning, with the help of insightful projects

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Train and evaluate neural networks built using TensorFlow for RL
* Use RL algorithms in Python and TensorFlow to solve CartPole balancing
* Create deep reinforcement learning algorithms to play Atari games
* Deploy RL algorithms using OpenAI Universe
* Develop an agent to chat with humans
